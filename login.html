                         The organ waiting list is always long. 
                         <br>Every day, there are approximately 107,000 people on the waiting list nationally for an organ. 
                         <br>People are dying while waiting for an organ. 
                         <br>Each day 17 people in the United States die waiting for a transplant.
                         <br>Organ donation is an opportunity to help others. 
                            People who are on an organ waiting list typically have end-stage organ disease that significantly impacts their quality of life and may be near the end of their life.
                            Receiving an organ can become a life-changing event for these people. 
                            It can also help a family work through the grieving process and deal with their loss by knowing their loved one is helping save the lives of others.

                         You can donate some organs and tissues while you’re alive.
                         <br>
                         Most living donations happen between family members or close friends. Other people choose to donate to someone they don’t know.

                         Nearly 6,000 living donations take place each year. That’s about four out of every 10 donations.

                      One of your kidneys
                      A kidney is the most common donation. Your remaining kidney removes waste from the body.

                      One liver lobe.
                      Cells in the remaining lobe grow or refresh until your liver is almost its original size. 
                      This happens in a short amount of time for both you and the receiving patient.
                    
                    <br>
                      A lung or part of a lung, part of the pancreas, or part of the intestines.
                      These organs don’t regrow. Both the portion you donate and the portion that remains function fully.
